# MoodleExtract
Slight enhancement to https://github.com/shcgitpf/moodle-course-backup-file-extractor. Since the .mbz file is basically a .tar.gz file, it now handles picking a destination folder, picking the mbz file, unzipping, extracting and uses the original project's code to pull the original files using files.xml.
